# CitiBike Data Analysis with Tableau

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this project was to analyze the NYC CitiBike data to determine whether a bike-sharing program is beneficial in major metropolitian cities around the world. By analyzing the bike sharing data for New York City we uncover some key findings which help decision-makers at companies like CitiBike determine if they would like to invest in a bike-sharing program in a major city. Using Pandas, Jupyter , and Tableau we are able to create a interactive dashboard that produces visualizations that help us understand the types of customers using this service, the peak hours, the trips categorized by weekdays, etc. By using the Python program and the Pandas library we are able to change the data type for one of the coloumns in the raw data. This helps us calculate the Checkout Times of Users by their Gender. Using Tableau we are able to create an interactive dashboard that can help decision makers at bike sharing companies make data driven decision to help grow their business and better serve their communities.
